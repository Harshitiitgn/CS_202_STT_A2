### Parallel Test Execution Analysis

#### 1. Flaky Tests Identified
tests/test_linkedlist.py
tests/test_compression.py
tests/test_heap.py

#### 2. Failure Causes Analysis
- tests/test_linkedlist.py: Shared memory access issue.
- tests/test_compression.py: Potential race condition due to file I/O.
- tests/test_heap.py: Timing issue, possibly due to concurrent modification.

#### 3. Speedup Data
- load (Workers: 1, Threads: auto): Speedup = 0.08x
- no (Workers: 1, Threads: auto): Speedup = 0.05x
- load (Workers: auto, Threads: 1): Speedup = 0.74x
- no (Workers: auto, Threads: 1): Speedup = 0.75x
- load (Workers: auto, Threads: auto): Speedup = 0.07x
- no (Workers: auto, Threads: auto): Speedup = 0.08x

#### 4. Recommendations
Consider using locks for shared resources and increasing timeouts.
